> xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

I learned this course 6.S081 by myself in 2023/7. This repo records my learning process. The most difficult labs for me are file system and mmap. You can see the according solution code with:
```bash
git checkout fs
git checkout mmap
```

The origin source code of xv6 without lab-solution code can be got with:
```bash
git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/xv6-labs-2021
```
Note that everytime when finish a lab, you need to checkout to another new branch. The command `git branch` is helpful to list all local branchs.

The course's Schedule table can be found [here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html). 

This is the best course of OS I've ever seen! Spending a continuous period of time to learn this course is very suggested. 

Enjoy!
